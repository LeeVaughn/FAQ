# Self Taught Programmers FAQ! 

This is a repo filled with the groups most **F**requently **A**sked/**A**nswered **Q**uestions!
So, without further a-do, let's get started!
***

1. What should I start with?
	+ The sky is the lmiit with this one! You have the ability to choose any langauge you want to start! The gerneral recommendation is to start with Python or  Javascript, but you can choose any language you choose to start, as most programming languages teach the same basic concepts!
2. "Is language x better than language y?"
	+ While there are very a many difference between langauges, please bear in mind that  every langauge was built wiht a different purpose in mind. Thus, comparing say Javascript to C, for example, is kind of pointless, as C is made for interacting with computer hardware, and Javascript was made for the browser.
3. What text editor/IDE should I use?
	+ This would depend on how you would like to work. Do you like customizability and simplicty, and try to compile stuff on the command line? You can use something like [Sublime][1] or [Visual Studio Code][2]. Like for your tool to help you with the compiling and code editing as well? Try out something like [Code Blocks][3] or fully-featured [Visual Studio][4]. Want to focus on a specific language (like Java, for instance)? Somethign like the many variations of [Eclipse][5], or maybe [NetBeans][6]. Really, the choice is up to you, and the amount of tools out there is virtually endless.
4. What is Version Control and should I use it?
	+ Version Control is a method of "backing up" your files in such a way that you can go back to a previous change, and it will allow you to recover to a previous state if you happen to make an unwanted change or lose your work. The recommendation is to look at tools like [Git][7], which is one of the most used tools in the industry currently. As for should you use it, the answer is more often than not yes. And why? Because tools like Git allows you to save any changes you have made to the project you are working on, and recover if things go bad (i.e accidentally deleted files, corrupted files, etc).
5. Is getting a degree worth it?
	+ While it is true that you can break into the industry without a degree and only your work and merits, a degree is still a good thing to have. This is because it opens up more doors further along the line when you have more experience and
